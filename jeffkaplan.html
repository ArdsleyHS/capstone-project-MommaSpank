    This is Jeff Kaplan, the head director of Overwatch. He has been with Overwatch for 5 years 
    and announced that he will step down from head director of Overwatch. Whenever I get a noreg headshot in game,
    I scream his name. This has become one of the most iconic thing about Overwatch. It is always to 
    blame Jeff for these mistakes. He has become a living legend and now we have part ways. However, he may return
    and restore peace to Overwatch fans. This is Jeff Kaplan's final message. I am leaving Blizzard Entertainment after 19 amazing years. 
    it was truly the honor of a lifetime to have the opportunity to create worlds and heroes for such a passionate 
    audience. I want to express my deep appreciation to everyone at blizzard who supported our games, our game 
    teams and our players. but i want to say a special thanks to the wonderful game developers that shared in the 
    journey of creation with me. Never accept the world as it appears to be. Always dare to see it for what it could be. I hope you do the same. 
    gg,
    jeffrey kaplan
